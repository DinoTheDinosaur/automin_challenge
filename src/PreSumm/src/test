started to write the deliverables . ( person1 ) . that 's great . , , starting to write . , deliverable . . that 's that 's excellent . ( person4 ) . ( person1 ) , i 'm hopeful about [ person8 ] . but i have n't heard from him back . and he 's not on the call either . so let 's - feel free to ping [ person8 ] . yourself as well . so the more- ( person4 ) .
