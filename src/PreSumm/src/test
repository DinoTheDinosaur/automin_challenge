the on the binding itself . if you have someone < unintelligible > in python maybe it could be useful . ( person3 ) . , there is people who used python around . so i think it would be very useful to share even if it 's not working at the moment , because we were like already start start looking at how to connect to that and maybe , maybe we will be able to to help with that issue as well . ( person5 ) . ( person3 ) publish it probably again to the public website , right ? would that be ? ( person5 ) . . . ( person3 ) . . . so that that will be great . so i 'll then directly pass it to [ person4 ] . well share the code so far to the public [ project1 ] web < unintelligible > . . . ( person5 ) . ( person3 ) [ person3 ] will ( started ) to [ person4 ] . . . i think that 's everything . so thank you for this long and exhausting call . sorry . remember , we need the details on the [ person9 ] from you . and we need to what was the other most important part the cho- the choice of the digital input . so the choice of the digital . and the [ person9 ] specifications . we will redraw the picture to make it clear that we want one more channel for the main stage . and we will we will be reliable ourse- will be responsible ourselves for the choice like which asr to run and what , but we do n't - we will only struggle with the main stage , and not with the other booths that would be responsibility of that company . and that 's it . right ? ( person5 ) . ( person3 ) , so . thank you very much . i do n't have any other questions myself , anyone else ? any other comments , questions ? ( person11 ) you get just one channel , and that will be it , right ? ( person3 ) , for june , we are getting only english channel . and we are expected to produce this videomixing thing and we will synchronize on this very soon . ( person11 ) so the channels they can be spread over space , right ? if you , if the main channel from the stage is available at the different physical locations . ( person3 ) ou . ( person11 ) it could be fine . ( person3 ) so , like , physically for the main [ organization6 ] congress . we need all these notebooks to be connected to the same hardware network which is indicated in the picture . the same ethernet . over switch or router . and as long as this is through , physically they can be anywhere . . ( person11 ) it 's . ( person3 ) , so i think that the all the the set up here is is like correct except for the sound which we have discussed . ? so . thank you very much [ person7 ] . thank you . if you are still there . ( person2 ) . sorry . [ person7 ] has leave for a second yet the call but everything is clear , thank you . and here is [ person2 ] . < laugh > ( person3 ) you are here all time . so you know , you have heard everything . [ person2 ] , right ? ( person2 ) , . ( person3 ) . that 's good . so we need to figure out like who will be implementing the the presenter and so on . so thank you . and um , have a good rest of the day . ( person2 ) bye . bye , bye .
